assignment1.cpp is a standalone C++ program that can be compiled with
the command:

    $ g++ -Wall assignment1.cpp -o pex1

Once compiled, the program can simply be run with:

    $ ./pex1

Where '$' represents the terminal prompt, and assuming assignment1.cpp
is in the directory in which the command is run.

The program uses a doubly linked list to satisfy all of the assignments
requirements.
    - The program allows the user to enter a reservation into the list,
      and satisfies all the user input validation. The user entered
      reservation is inserted into the list according to its pick up time,
      where the list is ordered from earliest pick up time to the latest.
    - The program "pick's up" the passenger with the earliest pick up time
      among all the reservations in the list, and displays an appropriate
      message if the list is empty when the user attempts to pick up
      a passenger.
    - The program allows the user to view all reservations in the list.
    - The program allows the user to terminate the program if the list is
      empty. If the list is empty when the user terminates, the program
      displays the number of processed reservations then exits. If the list
      is not empty, the program displays an appropriate message, ignores
      the request to terminate, and keeps running.
    - The program displays a menu of acceptable commands, and accepts upper
      and lowercase versions of the acceptable commands.

The program assumes that the user always enters a character for a command
and integer numbers for the hours and minutes.

UPDATED January 23:
    - Refactored linked list insertion and removal methods.
    - Separated class definitions and method implementations.

As of testing on January 23, 2018, there are no known bugs.
